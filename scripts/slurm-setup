# Environment variables that are intended to be used by the SETILab scripts
# directly should be prepended with "SETI_". Say you wanted all SETI scripts to
# have access to a "FOOBAR" environment variable, it should be named
# "SETI_FOOBAR". Note that this is only a convention and we have no way of
# actually enforcing this.
